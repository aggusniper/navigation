Learning CSS Grid

Practice CSS Grid case on Responsive Navigation

Also in this project I learnt something new about border
It's just like what if you want to add different fill in your border instead of using only one color.

and the border-image came to rescue it.

  border-image: linear-gradient(45deg, red, orange);
  
I just show you the syntax it is just like how it works in background-image.
